# Initialize a variable 'x' with a value of 0.
x = 0

# Start a loop that continues as long as 'x' is less than or equal to 10.
while x <= 10:
    # Print the current value of 'x' to the console.
    print(x)
    
    # Increment the value of 'x' by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
    x += 1

# The loop ends when 'x' becomes greater than 10.
# Print "finished" to indicate that the loop has completed.
